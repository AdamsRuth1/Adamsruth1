😊 Hello, I’m Adams Ruth, but I prefer to be addressed as Adams. I am a computer scientist with a specialization in software engineering.

🤓 Fun fact: I’m a daddy's girl!

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a second degree in the same field. I also have a diploma in Software Engineering from @altschoolafrica.

I am passionate about solving problems, no matter how small they may be. Currently, I use React, Vue, Tailwind, and Bootstrap in my projects, and I am also learning Next.js, Nuxt.js, and TypeScript as frontend frameworks.

💼 I am available for frontend or software engineering roles, including  internship and entry-level positions.

I'm open to collaboration—let's build something together and make a difference!
